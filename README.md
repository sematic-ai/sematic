[Sematic](https://sematic.dev) is an open-source ML development platform. It
lets ML Engineers and Data Scientists write arbitrarily complex end-to-end
pipelines with simple Python and execute them on their local machine, in a cloud
VM, or on a Kubernetes cluster to leverage cloud resources.

Sematic is based on learnings gathered at top self-driving car companies. It
enables chaining data processing jobs (e.g. Apache Spark) with model training
(e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), or any other arbitrary Python business logic into
type-safe, traceable, reproducible end-to-end pipelines that can be monitored
and visualized in a modern web dashboard.

channel](https://discord.gg/4KZJ6kYVax).

## Why Sematic

- **Easy onboarding** â€“ no deployment or infrastructure needed to get started,
  simply install Sematic locally and start exploring.
- **Local-to-cloud parity** â€“ run the same code on your local laptop and on your
  Kubernetes cluster.
- **End-to-end traceability** â€“ all pipeline artifacts are persisted, tracked,
  and visualizable in a web dashboard.
- **Access heterogeneous compute** â€“ customize required resources for each
  pipeline step to optimize your performance and cloud footprint (CPUs, memory,
  GPUs, Spark cluster, etc.)
- **Reproducibility** â€“ rerun your pipelines from the UI with guaranteed
  reproducibility of results

## Getting Started

To get started locally, simply install Sematic in your Python environment:

```shell
$ pip install sematic
```

Start the local web dashboard:

```shell
$ sematic start
```

Run an example pipeline:

```shell
$ sematic run examples/mnist/pytorch
```

Create a new boilerplate project:

```shell
$ sematic new my_new_project
```

Or from an existing example:

```shell
$ sematic new my_new_project --from examples/mnist/pytorch
```

Then run it with:

```shell
$ python3 -m my_new_project
```

To deploy Sematic to Kubernetes and leverage cloud resources, see our
[documentation](https://docs.sematic.dev).

## Features

- **Lightweight Python SDK** â€“ define arbitrarily complex end-to-end pipelines
- **Pipeline nesting** â€“ arbitrarily nest pipelines into larger pipelines
- **Dynamic graphs** â€“ Python-defined graphs allow for iterations, conditional
  branching, etc.
- **Lineage tracking** â€“ all inputs and outputs of all steps are persisted and
  tracked
- **Runtime type-checking** â€“ fail early with run-time type checking
- **Web dashboard** â€“ Monitor, track, and visualize pipelines in a modern web UI
- **Artifact visualization** â€“ visualize all inputs and outputs of all steps in
  the web dashboard
- **Local execution** â€“ run pipelines on your local machine without any
  deployment necessary
- **Cloud orchestration** â€“ run pipelines on Kubernetes to access GPUs and other
  cloud resources
- **Heterogeneous compute resources** â€“ run different steps on different
  machines (e.g. CPUs, memory, GPU, Spark, etc.)
- **Helm chart deployment** â€“ install Sematic on your Kubernetes cluster
- **Pipeline reruns** â€“ rerun pipelines from the UI from an arbitrary point in
  the graph
- **Step caching** â€“ cache expensive pipeline steps for faster iteration
- **Step retry** â€“ recover from transient failures with step retries
- **Metadata and collaboration** â€“ Tags, source code visualization, docstrings,
  notes, etc.
- **Numerous integrations** â€“ See below

## Integrations

- **Apache Spark** â€“ on-demand in-cluster Spark cluster
- **Ray** â€“ on-demand Ray in-cluster Ray resources
- **Snowflake** â€“ easily query your data warehouse (other warehouses supported
  too)
- **Plotly, Matplotlib** â€“ visualize plot artifacts in the web dashboard
- **Pandas** â€“ visualize dataframe artifacts in the dashboard
- **Grafana** â€“ embed Grafana panels in the web dashboard
- **Bazel** â€“ integrate with your Bazel build system
- **Helm chart** â€“ deploy to Kubernetes with our Helm chart
- **Git** â€“ track git information in the web dashboard
