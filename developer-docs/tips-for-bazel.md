# Bazel Tips

You can execute most things in this repo with bazel. Here are some particularly useful examples:

## Testing

This will execute all tests, including all supported versions of python.
```
bazel test //sematic/...
```

This will run a specific test (in this case the API client test), on the default python version.
The target path is the file path to to the python package where the test lives (`sematic.tests`
in the example below), followed by a colon and the name of the python module for the test
(`test_api_client` in this example).
```
bazel run //sematic/tests:test_api_client
```

This will run a specific test (in this case the API client test), on the python version indicated
by the `_py3X` (python 3.9 in the example below).
```
bazel run //sematic/tests:test_api_client_py39
```

If you are using VSCode, you can use the VSCode debugger with bazel while testing. First, you
need to add this to your VSCode `launch.json` configurations:
```
        {
            "name": "Python: Attach",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "attach",
            "port": 5724,
            "host": "localhost",
            "pathMappings": [
                {
                  "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
                  "remoteRoot": "."
                }
            ]
        },
```

Once you've done that, you can debug tests with bazel by:
- Running your test with `DEBUGPY=1`: `DEBUGPY=1 bazel run //sematic/tests:test_api_client`
- once the test has paused (should pause very quickly), execute the `Python: Attach` debug
configuration from your VSCode debug panel. It should attach to the debugger.
- While the debugger is running, you can use all the debugger features you'd expect: breakpoints,
stepping, variables and watch views, stack navigation, etc..


## IPython
You can open an iPython shell that contains the dependencies for any `sematic_py_lib`:
```
$ bazel run //sematic:api_client_ipython  # build //sematic:api_client and open a shell
In [1]: from sematic import api_client as api
```

You can also do this for specific versions of python by adding a `_py3X_` between the
name of the lib target and the `ipython`:
```
$ bazel run //sematic:api_client_py39_ipython  # build target and open a py3.9 shell
In [1]: from sematic import api_client as api
```

## Sematic examples
You can run Sematic examples by running one of the targets created with the
`sematic_example` build macro:
```
$ bazel run //sematic/examples/liver_cirrhosis:liver_cirrhosis
```

You can do this using a specific interpreter as well with a `_py3X` suffix:
```
$ bazel run //sematic/examples/liver_cirrhosis:liver_cirrhosis_py39
```

You can also open an ipython interpreter into the environment for the example:
```
$ bazel run //sematic/examples/liver_cirrhosis:liver_cirrhosis_py39_ipython
In [1]: from sematic.examples.liver_cirrhosis import *
```

## Sematic CLI
For the sematic CLI (as well as any other `sematic_py_binary`), you can run them
by just running their targets:

```
$ bazel run //sematic/cli:main -- --help
```

You can also do *this* with specific python interpreters:
```
$ bazel run //sematic/cli:main_py39 -- --help
```

## Miscellaneous
To clear the Bazel cache, run:

```
$ bazel clean --expunge
```

## Troubleshooting

### CPP Toolchain Error
If you get an error message like:

`"No matching toolchains found for types @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type"`,
this means bazel can't find your c++ tooling. This can either be due to the fact that
bazel can't find ANY c++ tooling OR the fact that it can't find c++ tooling suitable
for building linux docker images.

#### Totally missing c++ tooling
```
$ bazel test --toolchain_resolution_debug=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type //sematic/...
```

On Macs this is often due to a problem with Xcode. If you are on a Mac:
- Make sure you have xcode installed
- Execute `sudo xcodebuild -license` and agree to the license
- If the above command gives you an error about CommandLineTools and won't show
the License, try [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72115137/2540669)

#### Missing c++ tooling for cross platform docker images
Try this:
```
$ bazel test --@io_bazel_rules_docker//transitions:enable=false //sematic/...
```

This flag will NOT enable actually building images for remote execution
cross-platform, but WILL most likely unblock your ability to run tests.
If this doesn't work, please try to debug what you can and update these
tips!

### Docker credential error

If you get an error message like:
```
error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop":
```
Then you likely need to install Docker. On Mac, some people have found
that even if Docker does not work for them on their Mac, they need to
do this install. If you are in this situation, you may also need to add
`/Applications/Docker.app/Contents//Resources/bin` to your `PATH`.
