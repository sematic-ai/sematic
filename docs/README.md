## What is Sematic?

Sematic is an easy-to-use, lightweight development toolkit for Machine Learning (ML), Data Science (DS) and Analytics.

It aims to accelerate the prototyping, reporting, and productionization of ML and DS data workflows by abstracting away many infrastructure details, allowing users to focus on your data.

Sematic's features include:

* Integrations with common modern data stack APIs
* A (very) lightweight Python SDK to define nestable and dynamic graphs
* Almost-static and runtime type checking
* Execution backends: local and soon remote
* A semantic UI to monitor, inspect, and share pipelines and their artifacts
* End-to-end lineage tracking of all artifacts and assets for reproducibility and traceability
