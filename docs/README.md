# Hi ðŸ‘‹

We're glad you're here!

Whether you're a Machine Learning (ML) or Data Science (DS) developer, Sematic
makes you work faster by:

* Facilitating the transition from Jupyter Notebook prototype code to steady
  production-grade pipelines
* Helping you iterate, investigate, debug, and collaborate directly on
  production pipelines
* Automating ML/DS pipelines to keep models and metrics fresh and relevant as
  market and world conditions change

If you're new, read how to [Get Started](get-started.md) or join our [Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/4KZJ6kYVax).

If you want to dig deeper, check out the [Sematic Concepts](concepts.md), or the

## Who we are

We spent the last four years building the infrastructure behind
[Cruise](https://getcruise.com)'s [Continuous Learning
Machine](https://medium.com/cruise/cruise-continuous-learning-machine-30d60f4c691b),
which ensures safety-critical models keep learning as world conditions change.
We encountered all sorts of use cases from statistical modeling to performance
intensive data processing, and deep learning.

We are dedicated to bringing the most powerful tools and infrastructure to DS
and ML developers of all skills and background.

## What is Sematic?

Sematic is an easy-to-use, lightweight development toolkit for Machine Learning
(ML), Data Science (DS), or other workloads.

It aims to accelerate the prototyping, reporting, and productionization of ML
and DS workflows by abstracting away many infrastructure details and bringing
forth higher-level semantics.

Sematic's features include:

* An extremely lightweight Python SDK to define nestable and dynamic
  computational workflows
* Pseudo-static and runtime type checking
* Execution backends: local and cloud
* A semantic UI to monitor, inspect, and share pipelines and their artifacts
* End-to-end lineage tracking of all artifacts and assets for reproducibility
  and traceability

## Sematic contributors
