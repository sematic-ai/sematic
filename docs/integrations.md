Because Sematic Functions can contain arbitrary Python logic, you are free to
use the relevant libraries, SDKs, and APIs to integrate with arbitrary
third-party platforms and services such as Apache Spark, Snowflake, DBT, Google
Vertex AI, Slack, etc.

Additionally, our primary goal at Sematic is to make your life easier with
simpler and more friendly APIs. To this end, we are in the process of developing
helpers, types, and functions to help you interact with these external services.

When we do, we will have a dedicated page for it in this space.

Make sure to check our [public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/AznpHZ7e/sematic-public-roadmap) for what's coming, learn
