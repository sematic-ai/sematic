This chart assumes you have set up the following in advance:

## Infrastructure
- A valid Postgres database to hold Sematic's data.
- DNS and ingress to your Kubernetes server that will allow you to reach the deployed service
- If you wish to use HTTPS for access to your Sematic instance (recommended!), configure your ingress
  to handle the HTTPS.

## Secrets
### db-secret
- name: db-secret
- namespace: same namespace as the server is deployed to
- data: Should contain the key DATABASE_URL with a value containing a URL to a
  valid Postgres install including password. A sample kubectl command to create
  such a secret would be:
  kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:mYdBpA55worD@my.db.url.com:5432/my-database-name
