# This enables us to use websockets and standard HTTP requests in the same server locally,
# which is what we want. If you try to use Gunicorn to do this, gevent will complain about
# not monkey patching early enough, unless you have the gevent monkey patch applied VERY
# early (like user/sitecustomize).
