        The function this is a future of.
    kwargs: Dict[str, Any]
        The input arguments to the function. Can be concrete values or other

    standalone: bool

    original_future_id: Optional[str]
        The id of the original future this future was cloned from, if any.
    cache: bool
        Whether to cache the function's output value under the `cache_namespace`
        configured in the `Resolver`. Defaults to `False`.

    resource_requirements: Optional[ResourceRequirements]
        When using the `CloudResolver`, specifies what special execution
        resources the function requires. Defaults to `None`.
    retry_settings: Optional[RetrySettings]
        Specifies in case of which Exceptions the function's execution should be
        retried, and how many times. Defaults to `None`.
    timeout_mins: Optional[int]
        Specified how many minutes are allowed to be spent between the future entering the
