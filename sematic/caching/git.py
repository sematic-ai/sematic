def get_git_sha_caching_namespace(future: AbstractFuture) -> str:
    """
    Returns a caching namespace based on the specified `Future` func's source code git
    commit SHA.

    Must only be used when launching the `Resolution` from a development environment that
    is versioned by git! Otherwise, this will raise an exception, and the cache will not
    be used!

    When using this caching namespace, switching to another commit or locally editing the
    code would result in cache invalidation.

    Successive code edits will not invalidate the cache, as the dirty code status is only
    compared against the clean commit, and the actual contents of the code edits is not
    considered.

    Parameters
    ----------
    future: AbstractFuture
        The `Future` func for which to look up the code git commit status.

    Returns
    -------
    A caching namespace which contains the git commit SHA and the dirty code value.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the git information could not be found.
