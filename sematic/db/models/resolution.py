"""
Module defining the Resolution data model.

Note that this class is sometimes referred to as a "Pipeline Run."
It will be formally renamed to that with
https://github.com/sematic-ai/sematic/issues/959

Notes regarding container images
--------------------------------
In the case of cloud execution (using `CloudRunner`), the default behavior
uses a single container image for remote jobs (driver job + worker jobs). See
docs/multiple-base-images.md for the rationale behind this design choice.

As an undocumented behavior, Sematic supports different **base** images per
function. This works using a mapping of tag to base image specified by users in
the build information (`bases` argument to the `sematic_pipeline` Bazel target
at this time). Users then specify in the `sematic.func` decorator what base
image to use with the `base_image_tag` argument that should correspond to one of
the keys in the mapping passed to `sematic_pipeline`.

        managing. The resolution may have started getting too many 500s from the Sematic
        server, for example.

        The resolution is done, and it will do no more work. This status may be used even
        if the root run failed, so long as it failed due to some issue in the Sematic
        func execution and not for some other reason. It may also be used if the root run
        was canceled, so long as the cancellation was exited cleanly.

# - API client HTTP paths use "resolution" API paths
# - Server-side API supports only "resolution" HTTP paths
# - DB queries module uses "resolution" name
# - DB tables use "resolution" name
