    """Information about how to expose Kubernetes secrets when running a Sematic func.

    This can be used to mount credentials that the func may need to execute. To use it
    in this manner:

    1. Create a Kubernetes secret containing the credentials you need. The secret MUST be
        named "sematic-func-secrets" Instructions for this can be found here:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/
        In the "data" field of the secret, you should have key value pairs for every
        secret value you wish to expose for Sematic functions. For example, you might
        have the key `my-api-key` and the value `mYSu93Rs3cretKey`
    2. For the Sematic func that requires access to the secret, list it either as an
        environment secret (the secret's value will be stored in an environment variable)
        or as a file secret (the secret's value will be stored in a file).

    Before using Kubernetes secrets to give this kind of credential access, be aware that
    using them will allow anybody who can execute Sematic funcs in your cluster access to
    the secrets.
